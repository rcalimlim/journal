### **Challenges faced**
I ran into fewer unit testing challenges today than yesterday. My main roadblock was configuring TravisCI to work with my tests. I'm using a local test database to test my database methods, so I had to mimic that setup remotely in the TravisCI test environment.
### **Actions taken**
I used TravisCI's `before_script` hook to set up a test database and table with the same names my tests were expecting. I also seeded the database with a shell script that I included in the `script` hook.
### **Results/takeaways**
Porting a dev setup is a lot harder and more complex than I previously thought. I can see why programs like Docker are so powerful. This is a very simple project, yet it's taken days to setup tests that reliably work in other environments, which is time that could've been spent developing new features and better user experiences.

### **Challenges faced**
Today I dedicated my time to researching how to properly conduct unit testing for different server mechanisms, like routes, in isolation--essentially without having to spin up real databases or actually hit my server. It took all day.

The main issue was actually **how to mock nested dependencies from required modules**. I wanted to test my server routes *only*, yet whenever I required my Express server, it would attempt to connect to a database (that didn't exist), because my server file was requiring the database helper methods.
### **Actions taken**
Based on previous failed attempts to isolate components for durable unit tests, I knew that I figured *mocking* was the way to go, but I didn't know how to implement it. I tried to use Jest's mocking feature `jest.mock()`, to no avail.

In my opinion the Jest `mock` API is lacking. It took 4+ hours of searching to find the simplest of answers:
```javascript
jest.mock('../some/module', () => {
  // some functionality
});
```
Apparently `mock` takes a `filepath` and `callback`. The path should be for the module you want to mock and the callback should return a value, function, object, etc. that replaces the underlying functionality of the mocked module.

After mocking out the database helper methods, it was trivial to import the server without it trying to connect to a database that didn't exist.

### **Results/takeaways**
I learned a good deal from this experience. Besides the obvious benefit of learning how to unit test, I also came to realize that even well-supported tools, like Facebook's Jest, can lack solid documentation. Sometime you just have to spend hours searching for the answer you're pretty sure exists.

### Challenges faced
* I spent a good amount of last night working on a way to quickly generate *and* import 10 million records into PostgreSQL.
* I hadn't looked at my assigned component yet, so I tackled reading through the backend code base today. I ignored the front-end/am treating it like a black box. One thing that stood out to me was that the server was not easily testable--the server app was being declared in the same file that spun it up.
* While I was implementing basic server route tests, I realized that the database connection wasn't configured on my local machine yet. This threw errors when I ran my test suite for the server.
* Having a lot of trouble finding resources that explain and give examples of mocking out databases for unit testing.
### Actions taken
* I read the PostgreSQL documentation ([v11.4](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/index.html)) to get an idea of how to access and manipulate data in basic ways. I created some test databases and *relations* (the Postgres term for tables) to play around with the API.
* Once I felt comfortable with Postgres, I tried to generate the 10 million records. Using `faker.js`, I created a basic script that created 1 million records in memory then appended that to a file with `fs`. It came out to about 1.8GB uncompressed in CSV form.
* I used tar and gzip to archive and compress the CSV so I could link it out to my teammates. It came in under 600MB, which is a solid 3:1 compression ratio.
* I decided the fastest way to import the file was to use  the Postgres shell and [`COPY`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/sql-copy.html). The final import consistently took <50 seconds to complete, which was a huge win.
* To decouple my component's back-end for testing, I moved the Express app and route declaration to its own file, but continued to listen in `index.js`. This way the `app` could be imported easily into my test suite without the complication of port collisions.
* I used [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) and [SuperTest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) as my testing tools of choice. I chose Jest, because it's pretty complete out-of-the-box without much configuration. SuperTest was also an obvious choice because it's one of the most popular HTTP testing tools (~800k weekly downloads on npm!)
* I had to comment out lines that required the database in the app file for now, as I'm not currently writing tests for database methods. Commenting those out got rid of the testing errors. I'll revisit this at a later point during testing.
* For database unit testing, I researched `pg` and `pooling` (mostly this [github thread](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/issues/1056#issuecomment-243724074)) to see if I could mock out the postgres DB easily. Updates to come.
### Results/takeaways
* Overall, separating the test data creation and database insertion into distinct steps made it easier to quickly seed my database. This methodology will be especially useful for seeding the remote database when the time comes. (I also just realized I could just copy my local one!)
* Test Driven Development is up there on my goals list for this project, along with writing this journal. I failed to test first during my [FEC project](https://github.com/seabay-hratx42-fec/shopping-cart/) and wound up with almost no test coverage. I vow not to repeat the same mistakes this time around!
* I either don't understand unit testing for functionality that interacts with databases or there is a severe lack of documentation and resources for database functionality unit testing. This could be a niche I fill with some Medium articles at some point (assuming I ever figure it out).

## **23 July 2019**
### Challenges faced
* finding a quick way to generate large amounts of data
* researching database hosting options that allow massive amount of data to be stored for free
* finding a quick way to seed said databases over a remote connection
### Actions taken
* used `faker.js` to generate 10 million random products and saved it to files using node's `fs` library
* still need to do more research here--it seems that other cohort members are having trouble with traditional hosts like Atlas
### Results/takeaways
* I'm sure 10 million records pales in comparison to massive amount of data that enterprise databases store. It's interesting to see how quickly scaling issues derail the development process. Good lessons to learn now.
* I decided to use Cassandra (NoSQL) and PostgreSQL (SQL) as my databases of choice. This doesn't solve my hosting issues, but it's at least a direction to go.
