### **Challenges faced**
* I decided to use React Native to build a crypto currency price charter app.
* Originally, I was supposed to use Chart.js, but there was no easy way to use those libraries in a native env.
### **Actions taken**
* I researched React Native--learning the quickest way to get an app up and running was using Expo (I have an Android phone if you're wondering).
* Instead of Chart.js, I tried out `react-native-chartjs` and `react-native-chart-kit` to little success. I settled on [Victory](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/), another react native visualizer library.
### **Results/takeaways**
* React Native was not as plug-and-play as I had anticipated. I'd like to do further research into which libraries are portable and which are not. Though I'm sure the overall native dev process was still made significantly easier using React Native.
